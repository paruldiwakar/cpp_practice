n boxes : g[ i ] = weight of box i. Transport thrm using a truck of capacity C, in the order they are given. Sum of the weights of the boxes at each transport ride cant exceed C. Find the minimum C such that we can move all boxes using maximum K transport rides.
eg. input n = 6, k = 3 g = [ 7 3 2 3 1 4 ]
      output = 15
      input n = 6, k = 3 g = [ 3 4 1 6 2 4  ]
       output = 14
